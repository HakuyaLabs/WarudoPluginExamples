# Warudo Official Plugin Examples

This repo contains reference source code of selected official Warudo plugins.

## Overview

- **StreamDeck**: This plugin communicates with an external application (Warudo's [Stream Deck plugin](https://apps.elgato.com/plugins/warudo.streamdeck)) via WebSocket. It demonstrates the use of the WebSocket service base class `WebSocketService`.
- **VMC**: This plugin adds [VMC](https://protocol.vmc.info/english) as a supported motion capture method via registering a `FaceTrackingTemplate` and a `PoseTrackingTemplate`.
